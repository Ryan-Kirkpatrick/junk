# HSBNE Abandoned Spaces Policy

## What is an abandoned space?
An abandoned space is an area at HSBNE that is not managed by a team or the Executive committee, especially if the space is in disrepair. Whether or not a space in abandoned is at the discretion of an Executive vote.

## What happens to abandoned spaces?

### Zero days after a space is considered abandoned.

* The team nominally in charge of the space, if one exists, should be warned that the space in now considered abandoned and will have 30 days to rectify the issues before the next measures are taken.
* If no team exists, a call to form a team should be made by the Executive. If no team has materialized in 30 days then the next measures will be taken.

### 30 days after the space is considered abandoned.
* As soon as practical, the space will be downsized. The goal of the downsizing is to shrink the physical footprint, maintenance requirements, and costs associated with the space as much as possible while still retaining the bare minimum functionality of the space. This entails:
	* Storing all the consumable items. I.e. wire, glue, screws, etc.
	* Storing all the equipment that requires inductions.
	* Storing all equipment that is likely to require maintenance.
	* Storing duplicate and extraneous tools, machines, and equipment. E.g. if a space has several microscopes only one would be kept available.    
* A sign will be displayed in the abandoned space that explains how the space would become unabandoned and the timeframe for measures to be taken.
* For 90 days after the space is downsized the space may be claimed by a team that would carry on the purpose of that space. E.g. if the forge area were to become abandoned, a new team, with blacksmithing as its main objective, would be able to claim the space.

### 90 days after the space is downsized.

* The equipment and other items in storage may be sold off by passing a motion a motion to sell items and a general meeting.
* Other teams, new or existing, that have goals not necessarily aligned to the original purpose of the space, may take over the space by passing a motion at a general meeting. The remaining items in the space would be moved to storage. For example: if the woodshop area was to become abandoned then the existing metalshop team or a new team could move to take over the woodshop space and use it for whatever purposes they wished.

### 180 days after the space is downsized
* The remaining equipment in the space should be stored and the area completely packed up.
* Existing or new teams can claim the area freely. Where more than one team wishes to claim the space a motion shall be put forward at a general meeting to decide.

### 240 days after the space is downsized
* The Executive may begin liquidating the items from the space at their discretion by passing an Executive vote. 

## Other
### Items that are too large to be stored
Items that are too large to be stored should be consolidated as much as possible so that they take up a minimal footprint. E.g. a tablesaw is too large to be sotred but could be moved to a corner.
